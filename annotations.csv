half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting
people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly
was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label,
with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters. 

It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT
in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked
""poison"" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children
who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because
they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a
red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY
deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink
much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or
later. 

However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding
it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

high chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace.

The sight of it made her start; and, forgetting everything else, she

stood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossed

her:





""This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! An

immense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here?

Pushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look into

it—cost me what it may, I will look into it—and directly too—by

daylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out."" She advanced and

examined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker

wood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the

same. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end

were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps

prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was

a mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently,

but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. She could

not, in whatever direction she took it, believe the last letter to be

a T; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was

a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment. If not

originally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into the

Tilney family?





Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing,

with trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she resolved at all hazards

to satisfy herself at least as to its contents. With difficulty, for

something seemed to resist her efforts, she raised the lid a few inches;

but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her,

starting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence. This

ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her mistress to be of

use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her, it

recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing, and forced her,

in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in

her dressing without further delay. Her progress was not quick, for her

thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated

to interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment upon

a second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest. At

length, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toilette

seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might

safely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate

should be the exertion of her strength, that, unless secured by

supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. With

this spirit she sprang forward, and her confidence did not deceive her.

Her resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to her astonished eyes

the view of a white cotton counterpane, properly folded, reposing at one

end of the chest in undisputed possession!"

would be so many people in the house—and besides, it has never been

uninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come back

to it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens.""





""No, certainly. We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly

lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire—nor be obliged to spread

our beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture.

But you must be aware that when a young lady is (by whatever means)

introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always lodged apart from

the rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end of the

house, she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, up

a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment

never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years

before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind

misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber—too lofty and

extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take

in its size—its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as

life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even

a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?""





""Oh! But this will not happen to me, I am sure.""





""How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment! And

what will you discern? Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers,

but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other a

ponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace

the portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so

incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your

eyes from it. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by your appearance,

gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints.

To raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason to suppose that

the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informs

you that you will not have a single domestic within call. With this

parting cordial she curtsies off—you listen to the sound of her

receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you—and when,

with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover,

with increased alarm, that it has no lock.""





""Oh! Mr. Tilney, how frightful! This is just like a book! But it cannot

really happen to me. I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy.

Well, what then?""





""Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. After

surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed, you will retire to

rest, and get a few hours' unquiet slumber. But on the second, or at

farthest the third night after your arrival, you will probably have a

violent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice

to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains—and during

the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it, you will probably think

you discern (for your lamp is not extinguished) one part of the hanging

more violently agitated than the rest. Unable of course to repress your

curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will instantly

arise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examine

this mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a division in

the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection,

and on opening it, a door will immediately appear—which door, being

only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts,

succeed in opening—and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass through

it into a small vaulted room.""





""No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing.""





""What! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a

secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel

of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off? Could you shrink from so simple

an adventure? No, no, you will proceed into this small vaulted room,

and through this into several others, without perceiving anything very

remarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in another

a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument of

torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way,

and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own

apartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your

eyes will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony

and gold, which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you

had passed unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will

eagerly advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search into

every drawer—but for some time without discovering anything of

importance—perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. At

last, however, by touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will

open—a roll of paper appears—you seize it—it contains many sheets of

manuscript—you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber,

but scarcely have you been able to decipher 'Oh! Thou—whomsoever thou

mayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may

fall'—when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and leaves you in

total darkness.""





""Oh! No, no—do not say so. Well, go on.""





But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able

to carry it farther; he could no longer command solemnity either of

subject or voice, and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy

in the perusal of Matilda's woes. Catherine, recollecting herself, grew

ashamed of her eagerness, and began earnestly to assure him that her

attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really

meeting with what he related. ""Miss Tilney, she was sure, would never

put her into such a chamber as he had described! She was not at all

afraid.""





As they drew near the end of their journey, her impatience for a sight

of the abbey—for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects

very different—returned in full force, and every bend in the road was

expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey

stone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of the

sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows. But so

low did the building stand, that she found herself passing through the

great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger, without

having discerned even an antique chimney."
"slonaker@mit.edu","http://annotationstudio.herokuapp.com/documents/northanger-abbey",2012-09-15T16:33:06Z,"[]","The first of her fantasies to start, she believes the chest to hold some secret, when all it holds is Eleanor's old hats.","when her eye suddenly fell on a large

high chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace.

The sight of it made her start; and, forgetting everything else, she

stood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossed

her:





""This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! An

immense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here?

Pushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look into

it—cost me what it may, I will look into it—and directly too—by

daylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out."" She advanced and

examined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker

wood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the

same. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end

were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps

prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was

a mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently,

but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. She could

not, in whatever direction she took it, believe the last letter to be

a T; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was

a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment. If not

originally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into the

Tilney family?





Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing,

with trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she resolved at all hazards

to satisfy herself at least as to its contents. With difficulty, for

something seemed to resist her efforts, she raised the lid a few inches;

but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her,

starting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence. This

ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her mistress to be of

use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her, it

recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing, and forced her,

in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in

her dressing without further delay. Her progress was not quick, for her

thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated

to interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment upon

a second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest. At

length, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toilette

seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might

safely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate

should be the exertion of her strength, that, unless secured by

supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. With

this spirit she sprang forward, and her confidence did not deceive her.

Her resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to her astonished eyes

the view of a white cotton counterpane, properly folded, reposing at one

end of the chest in undisputed possession!





She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney,

anxious for her friend's being ready, entered the room, and to the

rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation,

was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search. ""That is

a curious old chest, is not it?"" said Miss Tilney, as Catherine hastily

closed it and turned away to the glass. ""It is impossible to say how

many generations it has been here. How it came to be first put in this

room I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought it might

sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets. The worst of it is that

its weight makes it difficult to open. In that corner, however, it is at

least out of the way."""
"slonaker@mit.edu","http://annotationstudio.herokuapp.com/documents/northanger-abbey",2012-09-15T16:34:47Z,"[]","This is the next instance of her imagination playing on her as she thinks some secret is in the dresser.","when, on giving a parting glance round the room, she was struck by the

appearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though in

a situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her notice before.

Henry's words, his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape

her observation at first, immediately rushed across her; and though

there could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, it

was certainly a very remarkable coincidence! She took her candle and

looked closely at the cabinet. It was not absolutely ebony and gold; but

it was japan, black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind; and as she

held her candle, the yellow had very much the effect of gold. The key

was in the door, and she had a strange fancy to look into it; not,

however, with the smallest expectation of finding anything, but it was

so very odd, after what Henry had said. In short, she could not sleep

till she had examined it. So, placing the candle with great caution on

a chair, she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn

it; but it resisted her utmost strength. Alarmed, but not discouraged,

she tried it another way; a bolt flew, and she believed herself

successful; but how strangely mysterious! The door was still immovable.

She paused a moment in breathless wonder. The wind roared down the

chimney, the rain beat in torrents against the windows, and everything

seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation. To retire to bed,

however, unsatisfied on such a point, would be vain, since sleep must be

impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed

in her immediate vicinity. Again, therefore, she applied herself to the

key, and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with

the determined celerity of hope's last effort, the door suddenly yielded

to her hand: her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and

having thrown open each folding door, the second being secured only by

bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though in that her

eye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers

appeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below them; and in

the centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in

all probability a cavity of importance.





Catherine's heart beat quick, but her courage did not fail her. With a

cheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her fingers

grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth. It was entirely empty.

With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second, a third, a

fourth; each was equally empty. Not one was left unsearched, and in not

one was anything found. Well read in the art of concealing a treasure,

the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her, and

she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain. The place in the

middle alone remained now unexplored; and though she had ""never from

the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the

cabinet, and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus

far, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was

about it."" It was some time however before she could unfasten the door,

the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of

the outer; but at length it did open; and not vain, as hitherto, was her

search; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back

into the further part of the cavity, apparently for concealment, and

her feelings at that moment were indescribable. Her heart fluttered, her

knees trembled, and her cheeks grew pale. She seized, with an unsteady

hand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertain

written characters; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations

this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold, resolved

instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest.





The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with

alarm; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction; it had yet some

hours to burn; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in

distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion,

she hastily snuffed it. Alas! It was snuffed and extinguished in one. A

lamp could not have expired with more awful effect. Catherine, for a

few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not a

remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath.

Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A violent gust

of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment.

Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, a

sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck

on her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweat

stood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and groping

her way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of

agony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To close her eyes in

sleep that night, she felt must be entirely out of the question. With

a curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated,

repose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too abroad so dreadful!

She had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blast

seemed fraught with awful intelligence. The manuscript so wonderfully

found, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning's prediction, how was it

to be accounted for? What could it contain? To whom could it relate?

By what means could it have been so long concealed? And how singularly

strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it! Till she had made

herself mistress of its contents, however, she could have neither repose

nor comfort; and with the sun's first rays she was determined to peruse

it. But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene. She

shuddered, tossed about in her bed, and envied every quiet sleeper. The

storm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even

than the wind, which struck at intervals on her startled ear. The very

curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another

the lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to

enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than

once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour after

hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed

by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she

unknowingly fell fast asleep."

expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had

shuddered over in books, for the roll, seeming to consist entirely of

small disjointed sheets, was altogether but of trifling size, and much

less than she had supposed it to be at first.





Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page. She started at its import.

Could it be possible, or did not her senses play her false? An inventory

of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before

her! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a washing-bill

in her hand. She seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with

little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing

new. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her in each. Two

others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more

interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball.

And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first

cramp line, ""To poultice chestnut mare""—a farrier's bill!"

I wonder why Austen included this?  Also wonder if the narrator is supposed to be Austen?  This got me curious on when novels first came about.  Apparently only in the 18th century. http://www.nvcc.edu/home/ataormina/novels/history/origins.htm","es, novels; for I will not

adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers,

of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the

number of which they are themselves adding—joining with their greatest

enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely

ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she

accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages

with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the

heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I

cannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such

effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in

threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let us

not desert one another; we are an injured body. Although our productions

have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any

other literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has

been so much decried. From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes

are almost as many as our readers. And while the abilities of the

nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who

collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and

Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne,

are eulogized by a thousand pens—there seems almost a general wish of

decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and

of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to

recommend them. ""I am no novel-reader—I seldom look into novels—Do not

imagine that I often read novels—It is really very well for a novel.""

Such is the common cant. ""And what are you reading, Miss—?"" ""Oh! It is

only a novel!"" replies the young lady, while she lays down her book

with affected indifference, or momentary shame. ""It is only Cecilia, or

Camilla, or Belinda""; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest

powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge

of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the

liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the

best-chosen language. Now, had the same young lady been engaged with a

volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would she

have produced the book, and told its name; though the chances must be

against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication,

of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of

taste: the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement

of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics of

conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their language,

too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age

that could endure it."

Could it be possible, or did not her senses play her false? An inventory

of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before

her! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a washing-bill

in her hand. She seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with

little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing

new. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her in each. Two

others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more

interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball.

And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first

cramp line, ""To poultice chestnut mare""—a farrier's bill! Such was the

collection of papers (left perhaps, as she could then suppose, by the

negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them) which

had filled her with expectation and alarm, and robbed her of half her

night's rest! She felt humbled to the dust. Could not the adventure of

the chest have taught her wisdom? A corner of it, catching her eye as

she lay, seemed to rise up in judgment against her. Nothing could now

be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies. To suppose that a

manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in

a room such as that, so modern, so habitable!—Or that she should be the

I agree most with this philosophy. God did not create man to run wild, but to be productive and fruitful and he gives us the best example. ","I shall briefly explain how I conceive this matter. Look round the
world: contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be
nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infinite number of
lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond
what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various
machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other
with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever
contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all
nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of
human contrivance; of human designs, thought, wisdom, and intelligence.
Since, therefore, the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer,
by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the
Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man, though possessed
of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work which
he has executed. By this argument a posteriori, and by this argument

Experience, therefore, proves, that there is an original principle of

those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had 
been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study 
would have been irksome, and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, 
we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of 
anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and 
corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest 
precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do 
not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition, or to have feared 
the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy; and a 
churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, 
from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I 
was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced to spend 
days and nights in vaults and charnel houses. My attention was fixed upon every 
object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how 
the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death 
succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders

infinite: whatever he wills is executed: but neither man nor any other

enjoyments; and how many days, weeks, and months, are passed by several

able to reach ecstasy and rapture; and in no one instance can it continue
for any time at its highest pitch and altitude. The spirits evaporate,
the nerves relax, the fabric is disordered, and the enjoyment quickly
degenerates into fatigue and uneasiness. But pain often, good God, how

economy of the animal creation, by which pains, as well as pleasures, are
employed to excite all creatures to action, and make them vigilant in the
great work of self-preservation. Now pleasure alone, in its various
degrees, seems to human understanding sufficient for this purpose. All
animals might be constantly in a state of enjoyment: but when urged by
any of the necessities of nature, such as thirst, hunger, weariness;
instead of pain, they might feel a diminution of pleasure, by which they
might be prompted to seek that object which is necessary to their
subsistence. Men pursue pleasure as eagerly as they avoid pain; at least
they might have been so constituted. It seems, therefore, plainly
possible to carry on the business of life without any pain. Why then is
any animal ever rendered susceptible of such a sensation? If animals can
be free from it an hour, they might enjoy a perpetual exemption from it;
and it required as particular a contrivance of their organs to produce
that feeling, as to endow them with sight, hearing, or any of the senses.
