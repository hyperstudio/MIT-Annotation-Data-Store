  "readme": "Nodetime - Performance Profiler and Monitor for Node.js Applications\n===========================================\nNodetime reveals response time and other internals of HTTP requests and underlying HTTP, database, file system and other API calls in your Node.js application. Coupled with related process and OS state information, real-time and historical metrics, monitoring as well as CPU and memory profiling it enables tracing performance problems down to the root cause. Nodetime supports multiple APIs including native HTTP client, file system, cluster and sockets, Socket.io, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Memcached and Cassandra. HTTP based data stores like CouchDB and Riak are supported via HTTP API.\n\nThe profiler running within the application securely sends profiling data to the Nodetime server, which forwards it to a browser in real-time.\n\nNodetime is a high level profiler designed to run in production environments. By hooking up to various APIs it gives developers clear API level visibility of performance, i.e. time and CPU usage, averages, stack traces and much more.\n\nFull documentation at [nodetime.com](http://nodetime.com) [Docs section](http://nodetime.com/docs).\n\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Dmitri Melikyan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
